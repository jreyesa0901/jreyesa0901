- 👋 Hi, I’m @jreyesa0901 and this is a temporary Github profile.
- 👀 I’m interested in open source for industrial applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning embedded systems development, specifically software; however, with hardware development experience.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open technology for industrial automation and security.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'll leave my CV (click this [link](https://github.com/jreyesa0901/jreyesa0901/blob/main/CV_2023_Reyes_English__no_foto.pdf?raw=true) )

- Basically what I have is experience programming State Machines for PLCs and Embedded Systems using C and RTOS for the latter; however, I involve myself into the system design and its troubleshoting when it comes to integration into industrial environments (EtherCAT mostly).
- You can see some captures of projects here [link](https://github.com/jreyesa0901/jreyesa0901/blob/main/Projects captures)

- Coming updates: 
* Projektarbeit report
* Eagle projekt
* Library for an embedded system based on STM32 using SOES
